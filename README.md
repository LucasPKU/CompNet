CompNet

This is the source code of paper "Order-free Medicine Combination Prediction With Graph
Convolutional Reinforcement Learning".

Overview
CompNet is an end-to-end model mainly based on graph convolutional networks (GCN) and reinforcement learning (RL). Patient information and  drug-drug interactions knowledge are utilized to provide safe and personalized prediction for  medication combination. CompNet is tested on real-world clinical dataset MIMIC-III. The MIMIC-III data set is avaiable at ""
